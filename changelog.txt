Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2019-03-23
  Changes:
    - Buffed all units health by about 80%.
    - All units are not affected by related base game technologies. E.G, SMG guys will do more damage when you research projectile damage.
    - Disabled base game worms/spitters acid on ground damage effect, as it was severely over-powered.
