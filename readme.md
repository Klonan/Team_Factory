## Team factory

--------------------------------------

The basic premise, is to turn Factorio into a game which natively and properly can support fun engaging PvP situations.

We achieve this using 3 features:
 - Character classes with unique abilities and weapons.
 - Craftable, automatable and controllable units. These will have different tiers, strengths, style and factory requirements
 - Factory building based around producing combat units, but using distinct ingredient and research paths:
    - Iron / fuel cell type units. EG coal and iron to make a fuel cell. Projectile and explosive weaponry.
    - Biological component units. EG water and coal to make a basic biological unit. Melee and acidic weaponry.
    - Battery and circuitry units. EG iron and copper to make a basic capacitor. Laser and plasma weaponry.

## Classes

WIP

We call each class an 'engineer'.

Rough types:
  - Reconissance engineer. Moves faster, has scouting wards, sniper rifle, harassment maybe. USed for scouting, attacking undefended outposts, causing havoc.
  - Tactical enigneer. Creates dispensers, teleporters. Uses medium damage weapons, Assault rifle, plasma shotgun etc. Focuses on support, factory building, etc.
  - Arbiter engineer. Moves slowly, heavy guy. Uses big slow guns, Multi-rocket launcher, plasma cannon, etc. Is like an assassin and focusing on player killing.
  - Stronghold engineer. Likes building a big wall. Good at defending, killing enemy units, entrenching outposts. Crowd control type weapons, flamethrower, grenade launcher etc.
  - Fabrication engineer. Good at setting up outposts and building train lines etc. Has mobile construction port, some special construction and repair related abilities.
  - Logistics engineer. Good at setting up the main factory areas? Maybe a generalist?

The idea is that there are different parts of the game people enjoy, some players like building spaghetts, some players like building trains and outposts, others like murdering things. We give the choide and flexibility in the classes, so the players can make themselves better at the playstyle they prefer.

 ### Units

 The units will have tiers, so the first tier is easily automatable, like red science, second tier is more invovled, etc.

Fuel cell units

These are like the terrans. Each unit is based on Iron and gears and bullets and guns. The whole faction revolves around Fuel cells.

1. Fuel cell of iron and coal
2. Advanced fuel cell of Steel and solid fuel
3. High tech fuel cell of Advanced metal and nuclear something etc.


Bio units

These are like the Zerg. They are generally somewhat easier to setup and automate, but not as effective in some ways. Use melee and acidic weaponry.

1. Simple bio component made of Coal and water
2. Advanced bio component of Crude oil and sulfur or something
3. High tech bio component of Uranium and something

Circuitry / battery units

Like the protoss. USes batteries and circuits etc. They use a lot of copper and circuitry. They use laser and plasma weaponry.

1. Simple capacitor of copper and iron and water or something
2. Advanced capacitor of battery and circuits
3. high tech using some advanced circtuits etc.

Each tier of the units will branch to 2/3 types of units, which each have some slightly different recipe:

For instance, Fuel cell and a SMG gives a marine type guy, Fuel cell and a armor and grenade give a marauder type unit

The tiers will require researching, and quite expensive.
So advanced fuel cells need you to use the fuel cells to research them,
The high tech cells need the advanced fuel cells etc.

The advanced cells also will require the normal fuel cells in their recipe!
This is important, so that small weak units are not continually spawned, and lag up the game.

The buildings used to craft and research the units should all be kinda unique, 
So the Fuel cell guys have a special looking lab, special looking assembler for the tiers, etc.

Other general things, gears, circuits,plates etc. use normal machines.
